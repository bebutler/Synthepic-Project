# Synthepic-Project
Music based project made for SOCIS at UA Little Rock 
The files that are included in this repository are python programs used to generate Sonic Pi code (Transcoder v1.2) and the main application interface (Synthepic). Please place all of the files in assets.zip as well as Auth.py, Automaton224.py, and the wav files into the same working directory as Synthepic.py for it to run without error (it leverages all of these files to function). This project is still a work in progress.
